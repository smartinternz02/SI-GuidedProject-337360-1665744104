One Year Life expectancy post thoracic surgery using IBM Watson Studio Machine Learning

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. In the United States, lung cancer claims more lives every year than colon cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer combined.

The American Cancer Societyâ€™s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:

About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)

About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)

Despite the very serious prognosis (outlook) of lung cancer, some people with earlier-stage cancers are cured. More than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point. The data is dedicated to classification problems related to the post-operative life expectancy in lung cancer patients: class 1 - death within one year after surgery, class 2 - survival. 

We will be using classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, and xgboost. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration and IBM deployment.
